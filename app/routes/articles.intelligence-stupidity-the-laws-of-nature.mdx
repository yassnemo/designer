title: 'What Does It Mean to Be Intelligent?'
abstract: From survival skills in ancient times to modern debates about IQ and creativity, the idea of intelligence has evolved dramatically. In this post, I explore how our understanding of "being smart" has shifted, dive into Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, and share lessons I’ve learned about embracing our unique strengths. Join me as we rethink what intelligence means today.

## Hello, friend!

As societies moved from scrappy, survival-driven days to the sleek, structured world we live in now, something fascinating happened to how we think about intelligence. Back then, being smart wasn’t about acing a math test or dreaming up the next big app—it was about *staying alive*. Can you hunt a deer with nothing but a spear? Can you build a shelter before the storm hits? Can you pivot when the plan goes south? *That* was intelligence, raw and real.

But as the world got more organized—cities, schools, Wi-Fi—the meaning of intelligence started to shift. Suddenly, it wasn’t just about surviving the day; it became about imagining what tomorrow could hold. Fast forward to today, and everyone’s got a take on what “smart” means. Parents preach good grades and grit, [social media influencers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2023/02/03/the-rise-of-influencer-culture/) hype creativity and hustle, and thought leaders like [Daniel Goleman](https://www.danielgoleman.info/) champion [emotional intelligence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotional-intelligence). It’s a whirlwind of ideas, and I’m here to unpack it with you. 😊



## A New Lens on Intelligence

I recently dove into [*Frames of Mind*](https://www.howardgardner.com/books) by [Howard Gardner](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/howard-gardner), and let me tell you, it flipped my perspective. Gardner argues that we can’t box intelligence into a single definition—like [IQ tests](https://www.mensa.org/iq/what-iq) or report cards try to do. Instead, he proposes **multiple intelligences**, each a unique way we shine. Here’s the lineup:

- **Linguistic Intelligence**: Mastery of words, like poets or storytellers weaving magic with language.
- **Logical-Mathematical Intelligence**: Cracking puzzles and reasoning like a [data scientist](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-data-scientist) or mathematician.
- **Musical Intelligence**: Hearing and creating rhythms, like a composer or a [lo-fi beatmaker](https://www.chillhop.com/).
- **Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence**: Commanding your body, like dancers or athletes moving with precision.
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Thinking in visuals, like architects or artists imagining 3D worlds.
- **Interpersonal Intelligence**: Reading people and connecting, like a therapist or a charismatic leader.
- **Intrapersonal Intelligence**: Knowing yourself deeply, like a philosopher reflecting on their own motivations.

Gardner’s theory hit me hard because it celebrates how diverse we are. As a Data Science student, I’m all about [logical-mathematical intelligence](https://www.python.org/)—think coding in [Python](https://www.python.org/) or wrestling with datasets in [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). But I also geek out over [Dostoevsky](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fyodor-Dostoyevsky)’s linguistic brilliance in [*Crime and Punishment*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2554) and spend hours reflecting on my own emotions (hello, intrapersonal vibes). It’s like we’re all juggling different intelligences, and that’s what makes us human.


## Things I’ve Learned

### 1. The Battle Within

[Robert Greene](https://www.robertgreene.net/) once wrote, *“You are your own worst enemy, you waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present.”* Ouch, that stings. I’ve caught myself procrastinating—scrolling [X](https://x.com/) instead of writing, or daydreaming about a sci-fi novel instead of coding. Greene’s point is clear: intelligence isn’t just about raw ability; it’s about *showing up*. When I focus on the present, whether it’s debugging a script or drafting a blog post, I feel sharper, more alive. Procrastination is the real enemy, and I’m learning to fight it one small step at a time.

### 2. Intelligence Is a Shape-Shifter

Gardner’s theory taught me that intelligence isn’t one-size-fits-all. What’s “smart” in one context—like solving equations in a classroom—might not shine in another, like navigating a heated debate or crafting a melody. In some cultures, storytelling is the ultimate intelligence; in others, it’s building tools. As a data science nerd, I see this in my field: a brilliant coder might struggle with [empathy](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/empathy/definition), while a team leader’s interpersonal skills save the day. It’s a reminder to value every kind of smarts, from the [philosopher’s introspection](https://www.iep.utm.edu/kierkega/) to the artist’s vision.

### 3. Stop Comparing Yourself

*“Comparison is the thief of joy,”* said [Theodore Roosevelt](https://www.nps.gov/thro/index.htm). Man, was he right. I used to stress about not being as “smart” as my peers—maybe they published a paper or nailed a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/). But their journey isn’t mine. Maybe I’m not a machine learning prodigy (yet 😉), but I bring my own mix to the table: a knack for words, a love for [philosophy](https://www.philosophybasics.com/), and a curiosity that won’t quit. Focusing on what makes me *me*—like writing this blog or geeking out over [human behavior](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/behaviorism)—is way more fulfilling than chasing someone else’s path.



## Why This Matters

In a world obsessed with metrics—test scores, followers, likes—it’s easy to feel like intelligence is a number or a ranking. But Gardner’s ideas, and my own journey, show there’s more to it. Intelligence is personal, messy, and beautifully diverse. It’s the hunter’s cunning, the coder’s logic, the poet’s heart, and the friend who always knows what to say. As I navigate data science and dream of writing a [sci-fi epic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/), I’m learning to embrace all my intelligences, from crunching numbers to chasing big questions about [why we do what we do](https://www.ted.com/topics/psychology).

So, what does intelligence mean to you? Is it acing a test, connecting with someone, or creating something new? Drop a comment or hit me up on my [contact page](/contact)—I’d love to hear your take. Let’s keep this conversation going and celebrate the many ways we’re smart.

Stay curious, keep shining, and see you in the next post!

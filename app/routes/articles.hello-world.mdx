## A Spark in the Rain

It all started on a rainy afternoon when I was 15, curled up in my bedroom with a dog-eared copy of [*Crime and Punishment*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2554). [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fyodor-Dostoyevsky)’s words hit me like lightning—Raskolnikov’s tormented mind, the gritty streets of St. Petersburg, the weight of every choice. I was hooked. That night, I grabbed a notebook and started scribbling my own story: a tale of a wanderer in a neon-lit city, wrestling with fate. It wasn’t [Shakespeare](https://www.folger.edu/shakespeare), but it was *mine*. That’s when I knew words could be my superpower.


Fast forward to four years ago, when my curiosity was outgrowing my brain. I was devouring books, articles, and random [Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) on everything from [neural networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to [Nietzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/). The ideas were piling up like unopened mail, begging to be shared. So, I combined my love for reading with my knack for writing, and this blog was born. The posts you’ll find here are my thoughts—some half-baked, some polished over years—spilled onto the page with a mix of heart and hustle.

## The Ritual of Writing

How do I get these ideas out of my head? Picture me in a quiet café corner, nursing a coffee that’s gone cold, with [lo-fi beats](https://www.chillhop.com/) humming through my earbuds. I’m not one for rigid outlines—my writing feels like a chat with a friend, messy and free. But when [writer’s block](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-overcome-writers-block) creeps in, I’ve got tricks up my sleeve. A walk in the park, a quick doodle in my journal, or a rant to my best friend can shake the ideas loose. Oh, and I’m a total notebook hoarder—stacks of them, stuffed with quotes, sketches, and story snippets that might one day become something epic.



## What Lights My Fire

As a Data Science student, I spend my days untangling code and chasing patterns in data with tools like [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). But this blog isn’t just about algorithms (though I might sneak in a post about [AI ethics](https://aiethics.princeton.edu/)). It’s a playground for my curiosity, where I’ll dive into everything from Russian literature to the weird ways humans behave. I’m obsessed with Dostoevsky—say what you want about his “depressing” vibe, but the guy cracked open the human soul like nobody else. *Crime and Punishment* is my desert-island book, hands down.

I’m also a sucker for [philosophy](https://www.philosophybasics.com/), [religion](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/), and [history](https://www.history.com/). A single line from [Kierkegaard](https://www.iep.utm.edu/kierkega/) can send me spiraling into thoughts about faith, fate, or a random event from the 1800s. But my real fascination? The human mind. Why do we dream big, then procrastinate? Why do we love, fight, or chase impossible goals? These questions are the pulse of my writing, and I’m here to explore them with you.


## The Dream and the Journey

This blog is my canvas, but I’ve got bigger dreams. One day, I want to write a novel—a sci-fi epic that weaves philosophy, adventure, and a touch of [*Interstellar*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/)-style wonder. Think Dostoevsky meets a wormhole. For now, though, I’m thrilled to share these posts with you. My goal? To spark your curiosity, make you think, or at least give you a chuckle at the absurdity of being human. I’m not here to preach—I’m just sharing notes from my journey, hoping they resonate.

## Why Words Still Matter

In a world where [AI](https://www.x.ai/) can spit out text faster than you can blink, you might wonder if writing still has a soul. I say it does. There’s something electric about reading someone’s raw, honest thoughts—their quirks, their passions, their questions. It’s like a conversation across time. I hope my words feel like that for you, whether you’re sipping coffee or scrolling late at night.

## Let’s Talk

As I keep churning out posts (fingers crossed I stay on track!), I want this to be a two-way street. What fuels *your* curiosity? What books or ideas keep you up at night? Drop a comment, shoot me a message, or check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) to see more of my work. I’m so glad you’re here. Let’s explore the wild, wonderful world of ideas together.

Stay amazing, keep grinding, and see you in the next post!

Much, much love,

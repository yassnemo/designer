title: 'Change of Heart, Change of Thought…'
abstract: From survival skills in ancient times to modern debates about IQ and creativity, the idea of intelligence has evolved dramatically. In this post, I explore how our understanding of "being smart" has shifted, dive into Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, and share lessons I’ve learned about embracing our unique strengths.

Hello friend, 

I remember back when I was a kid, my father would turn on the news and start watching, and I’d just sit there, all grumpy, because all I wanted was to watch Tom and Jerry. 

I couldn’t quite understand what was so important about this guy on the screen, just staring at me with only his mouth moving, while the scenes kept cutting to random stuff now and then.

 It made no sense to me whatsoever, 

I mean why on earth would you care about the news when cartoons were so much better?

Fast forward 15 years later, and there I was, sitting in the exact same spot my father used to, watching that same guy with the moving mouth,

but this time with total attention, hanging on his every word about the world and what was happening. 

Meanwhile, my lovely little sister Imane would plop down next to me, all grumpy, because I’d grabbed the remote and wouldn’t let her watch her beloved Tom and Jerry. 

“The news is important,” I’d tell her, echoing my dad without even realizing it.

I mean, what changed? At a certain time I was in my sister’s shoes, Tom and Jerry was everything to me. 

And now, well, I’m just like my father used to be. 

Did I just grow up or what? 

Did the news really just crush my beloved Tom and Jerry on the scale of what is more important to me? 

Could it be just this or is there something else?

Well...

It’s actually quite funny how life turns things around. 

It really is, 

The lesson? What we value changes with time. 

Something that once seemed totally meaningless at a certain point, like some talking head on the news, can become the most crucial thing in your life at another, while what you once loved, like cartoons, fades into the background. 

It’s a sharp reminder that perspectives shift, circumstances change and what matters most to us can flip in an instant.

You can have all the money in the world, and think that nothing can shake you down. 

Before you know it, your son or daughter is sick and is in need of a miracle to survive, at that exact moment, no amount of money will be as important as you once thought it was.

Maybe this made you reflect upon on somethings, maybe it didn’t do anything.

That’s the funny part about all this,

You can read this article at one point in your life and laugh it, think it’s a joke, think who the hell does this guy think he is— Carl Jung?

 At another point, maybe, just maybe, you might have just stumbled upon the manuscript which will change your entire perspective on life.

So,

Don’t hold on to things, 

Don’t be stubborn,

Don’t shy away from change,

Don’t think your thoughts are always going to be the same, cause they’re not. 

YOU are not going to always be the same You, 

So, just keep getting better not the other way around, ok. 

Much much Love,

Yassine X

## Install & run

Make sure you have nodejs `19.9.0` or higher and npm `9.6.3` or higher installed. Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Once it's done start up a local server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To view the components storybook:

```bash
npm run dev:storybook
```

## Deployment

I've set up the site using Cloudflare for hosting. Deploy the site to Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```


  <summary>How do I get the contact form to work?</summary>
  
  To get the contact form working create an AWS account and set up SES (Simple Email service). Then plug in your details into `.dev.vars.example` and rename it to `.dev.vars`. You'll also need to add these as enviroment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard for it to work in production. Or if you don't mind sending through gmail use [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) instead.
